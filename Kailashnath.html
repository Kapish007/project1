                <p class="card-text">The Kailasha (IAST: Kailāśa) or Kailashanatha (IAST: Kailāśanātha) temple is the
                    largest of the rock-cut Hindu temples at the Ellora Caves, Maharashtra, India. A megalith carved
                    from a rock cliff face, it is considered one of the most remarkable cave temples in the world
                    because of its size, architecture and sculptural treatment, and "the climax of the rock-cut phase
                    of Indian architecture".The top of the superstructure over the sanctuary is 32.6 metres (107
                    feet) above the level of the court below,although the rock face slopes downwards from the rear
                    of the temple to the front. </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    The Kailasa temple (Cave 16) is the largest of the 34 Buddhist, Jain and Hindu cave temples and
                    monasteries known collectively as the Ellora Caves, ranging for over 2 kilometres (1.5 miles) along
                    the sloping basalt cliff at the site. Most of the excavation of the temple is generally
                    attributed to the eighth century Rashtrakuta king Krishna I (r. c. 756 – 773), with some elements
                    completed later. The temple architecture shows traces of Pallava and Chalukya styles. The temple
                    contains a number of relief and free-standing sculptures on a grand scale equal to the architecture,
                    though only traces remain of the paintings which originally decorated it.</p>

                    <p class="font-weight-bold">History of Kailasa temple</p>
                    <p class="card-text"> Kailasa temple lacks a dedicatory inscription, but there is no doubt that it
                        was commissioned by a Rashtrakuta ruler. Its construction is generally attributed to the
                        Rashtrakuta king Krishna I (r. 756-773 CE), based on two epigraphs that link the temple to
                        "Krishnaraja" (IAST Kṛṣṇarāja):

                    <p class="card-text"> The Vadodara copper-plate inscription (c. 812-813 CE) of Karkaraja II (a ruler
                        of a Rashtrakuta
                        branch of Gujarat) records the grant of a village in present-day Gujarat. It mentions
                        Krishnaraja as the patron of Kailasanatha, and also mentions a Shiva temple at Elapura (Ellora).
                        It states that the king constructed a temple so wondrous that even the gods and the architect
                        were astonished. Most scholars believe that this is a reference to the Kailasa Shiva temple
                        at Elora.<br>
                        The Kadaba grant of Govinda Prabhutavarsha similarly appears to credit Krishnaraja with the
                        construction of the temple.</p>

                    <p class="card-text"> However, the attribution of the temple to Krishna I is not completely certain
                        because these
                        epigraphs are not physically connected to the caves, and do not date Krishnaraja's reign.
                        Moreover, the land grants issued by Krishna's successors do not contain any references to the
                        Kailasa temple.</p>

                    <p class="card-text"> The Kailasa temple features the use of multiple distinct architectural and
                        sculptural styles.
                        This, combined with its relatively large size, has led some scholars to believe that its
                        construction spanned the reigns of multiple kings. Some of the temple reliefs feature the
                        same style as the one used in the Dashavatara cave (Cave 15), which is located next to the
                        temple. The Dashavatara cave contains an inscription of Krishna's predecessor and nephew
                        Dantidurga (c. 735–756 CE). Based on this, art historian Hermann Goetz (1952) theorized that
                        the construction of the Kailasa temple began during the reign of Dantidurga. Krishna consecrated
                        its first complete version, which was much smaller than the present-day temple. According to
                        Goetz, Dantidurga's role in the temple construction must have been deliberately suppressed, as
                        Krishna sidelined Dantidurga's sons to claim the throne after his death.Based on analysis
                        of the different styles, Goetz further hypothesized that the later Rashtrakuta rulers also
                        extended the temple. These rulers include Dhruva Dharavarsha, Govinda III, Amoghavarsha, and
                        Krishna III. According to Goetz, the 11th century Paramara ruler Bhoja commissioned the
                        elephant-lion frieze on the lower plinth during his invasion of Deccan, and added a new layer of
                        paintings. Finally, Ahilyabai Holkar commissioned the last layer of paintings in the temple.</p>

                    <p class="card-text"> M. K. Dhavalikar (1982) analyzed the architecture of the temple, and concluded
                        that the major
                        part of the temple was completed during the reign of Krishna I, although he agreed with Goetz
                        that some other parts of the temple complex can be dated to the later rulers. According to
                        Dhavalikar, the following components were completed by Krishna: the main shrine, its gateway,
                        the nandi-mandapa, the lower-storey, the elephant-lion frieze, the court elephants and the
                        victory pillars.Dhavalikar admits that the most important sculpture of the temple, which
                        depicts Ravana shaking the Kailasa mountain, appears to have been built after the main edifice.
                        This sculpture is considered as one of the finest pieces of Indian art, and it is possible that
                        the temple came to be known as Kailasa after it. Dhavalikar theorizes that this sculpture was
                        carved around 3-4 decades after the completion of the main shrine, on the basis of its
                        similarity to the tandava sculpture in the Lankeshvar cave.[H. Goetz dated this relief to
                        the reign of Krishna III.Like Goetz, Dhavalikar attributes some other structures in the
                        temple complex to the later rulers. These include the Lankeshvar cave and the shrine of the
                        river goddesses (possibly constructed during the reign of Govinda III).Dhavalikar further
                        theorizes that the excavation of the Dashavatara cave, which began during the reign of
                        Dantidurga, was completed during the reign of Krishna I. This explains the similarities between
                        the sculptures in the two caves.

                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Kailasa Design?</p>

                    <p class="card-text">The Kailasa temple architecture is different from the earlier style prevalent
                        in the Deccan region. As stated above, it appears to be based on the Virupaksha Temple at
                        Pattadakal and the Kailasa temple at Kanchi, but it is not an exact imitation of these two
                        temples. The southern influence on the temple architecture can be attributed to the
                        involvement of Chalukya and Pallava artists in its construction. The indigenous Deccan
                        artisans appear to have played a subordinate role in the temple's construction.</p>
                    <img src="Kailasa/map_1_780x600.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    <p class="card-text">
                        The entrance to the temple courtyard features a low gopuram.[1] Most of the deities at the left
                        of the entrance are Shaivaite (affiliated with Shiva) while on the right hand side the deities
                        are Vaishnavaites (affiliated with Vishnu). A two-storeyed gateway opens to reveal a U-shaped
                        courtyard. The dimensions of the courtyard are 82 m x 46 m at the base. The courtyard is
                        edged by a columned arcade three stories high. The arcades are punctuated by huge sculpted
                        panels, and alcoves containing enormous sculptures of a variety of deities. Originally flying
                        bridges of stone connected these galleries to central temple structures, but these have fallen.
                        Some of the most famous sculptures are Shiva the ascetic, Shiva the dancer, Shiva being warned
                        by Parvati about the demon Ravana, and river goddess.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                        Within the courtyard, there is a central shrine dedicated to Shiva, and an image of his mount
                        Nandi (the sacred bull). The central shrine housing the lingam features a flat-roofed mandapa
                        supported by 16 pillars, and a Dravidian shikhara. The shrine – complete with pillars,
                        windows, inner and outer rooms, gathering halls, and an enormous stone lingam at its heart – is
                        carved with niches, plasters, windows as well as images of deities, mithunas (erotic male and
                        female figures) and other figures. As is traditional in Shiva temples, Nandi sits on a porch in
                        front of the central temple. The Nandi mandapa and main Shiva temple are each about 7 metres
                        high, and built on two storeys. The lower stories of the Nandi Mandapa are both solid
                        structures, decorated with elaborate illustrative carvings. The base of the temple has been
                        carved to suggest that elephants are holding the structure aloft. A rock bridge connects the
                        Nandi Mandapa to the porch of the temple. The base of the temple hall features scenes from
                        Mahabharata and Ramayana. .</p>
