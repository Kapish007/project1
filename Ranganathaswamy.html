                <p class="card-text"> The Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple or Thiruvarangam is a Hindu temple dedicated to
                    Ranganatha, a reclining form of the Hindu deity Maha Vishnu, located in Srirangam, Tiruchirapalli,
                    Tamil Nadu, India.Constructed in the Dravidian architectural style, the temple is glorified by
                    Alvars in their Divya Prabhanda and has the unique distinction of being not only the foremost
                    among the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to Vishnu, but also the largest functioning Hindu temple in
                    the world.<br>

                    It is one of the most illustrious Vaishnava temples in South India rich in legend and history. The
                    temple has played an important role in Vaishnavism history starting with the 11th-century career of
                    Ramanuja and his predecessors Nathamuni and Yamunacharya in Srirangam.Its location, on an island
                    between the Kollidam and Kaveri rivers,has rendered it vulnerable to flooding as well as the
                    rampaging of invading armies which repeatedly commandeered the site for military encampment.The
                    temple was looted and destroyed by the Delhi Sultanate armies in a broad plunder raid on various
                    cities of the Pandyan kingdom in early 14th century. The temple was rebuilt in late 14th
                    century,the site fortified and expanded with many more gopurams in the 16th and 17th
                    centuries.It was one of the hubs of early Bhakti movement with a devotional singing and
                    dance tradition, but this tradition stopped during the 14th century and was revived in a limited way
                    much later.<br>

                    The temple occupies an area of 155 acres (63 ha) with 81 shrines, 21 towers, 39 pavilions, and many
                    water tanks integrated into the complex making it the world's largest functioning Hindu
                    temple.The temple town is a significant archaeological and epigraphical site, providing a
                    historic window into the early and mid medieval South Indian society and culture. Numerous
                    inscriptions suggest that this Hindu temple served not only as a spiritual center, but also a major
                    economic and charitable institution that operated education and hospital facilities, ran a free
                    kitchen, and financed regional infrastructure projects from the gifts and donations it
                    received.<br>

                    The Srirangam temple is the largest temple compound in India and one of the largest religious
                    complexes in the world.Some of these structures have been renovated, expanded and rebuilt
                    over the centuries as a living temple. The latest addition is the outer tower that is 67 metres (220
                    ft) tall, completed in 1987.Srirangam temple is often listed as one of the largest functioning
                    Hindu temple in the world, the still larger Angkor Wat being the largest existing temple.The
                    temple is an active Hindu house of worship and follows Thenkalai tradition of Sri Vaishnavism. The
                    annual 21-day festival conducted during the Tamil month of Margazhi (Decemberâ€“January) attracts 1
                    million visitors. The temple complex has been nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and is in
                    UNESCO's tentative list.</p><br>

                    <p class="card-text">The Ranganathaswamy Temple at Srirangam, also known as Thiruvaranga Tirupati,
                        is located about 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) north of the city of Tiruchirappalli, about 325
                        kilometres (200 mi) southwest of Chennai. The city is connected daily to other major cities by
                        the network of Indian Railways, Tamil Nadu bus services and the Highway 38.The site is
                        near the Tiruchirappalli International Airport (IATA: TRZ).
                        Srirangam temple complex across the river on left.

                        The temple site is on a large island bounded by the Kaveri River and Kollidam River.It is
                        vast and planned as a temple town with Sapta-Prakaram design where the sanctum, gopuram,
                        services and living area are co-located in seven concentric enclosures. Rampart walls were added
                        after medieval centuries that saw its invasion and destruction. The temple monuments are located
                        inside the inner five enclosures of the complex, surrounded by living area and infrastructure in
                        outer two enclosures. Numerous gopurams connect the Sapta-Prakaram enclosures allowing the
                        pilgrims and visitors to reach the sanctum from many directions.The site includes two
                        major temples, one for Vishnu as Ranganatha, and other to Shiva as Jambukeshvara. The island has
                        some cave temples, older than both.

                    <img src="Ranganathaswamy/1_1_780x500.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    <p class="card-text">The temple is enclosed by 7 concentric enclosures with courtyards (termed
                        prakarams or mathil suvar). Each layer has walls and gopurams, which were built or fortified in
                        and after the 16th century. These walls total 32,592 feet (9,934 m) or over six miles. The
                        temple has 17 major gopurams (towers, 21 total),[note 3] 39 pavilions, 50 shrines, 9 sacred
                        water pools, Ayiram kaal mandapam (a hall of 1000 pillars) and several small water bodies
                        inside.<br></p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        The temple is aligned to the north-south and east-west axis, on an island surrounded by the
                        Kaveri River. The river has long been considered sacred, and called the Daksina Ganga or the
                        "Ganges of the South".The outer two prakarams (outer courtyard) are residential and markets
                        with shops, restaurants and flower stalls.The five inner courtyards have shrines to
                        Vishnu and his various avatars such as Rama and Krishna. Major shrines are additionally
                        dedicated to goddess Lakshmi and many saints of Vaishnavism. In particular, these shrines
                        celebrate and commemorate the Tamil poet-saints and philosophers called the Alvars, as well
                        Hindu philosophers such as Ramanuja and Manavala Mamunigal of Sri Vaishnavism tradition.<br>
                    </p>
                    Despite the construction of various mandapas and gopuras over a span of many centuries, the
                    architecture of the Ranganathaswamy temple is one of the better illustrations of Hindu temple
                    planometric geometry per agama design texts in the Tamil tradition. According to George Michell,
                    a professor and art historian on Indian architecture, the regulating geometry and plan of
                    Srirangam site takes on "a ritual dimension since all the architectural components, especially
                    the focal gopuras and the most important colonnades and mandapas, are arranged along the axes
                    dictated by the cardinal directions". This alignment integrates the routes that devotees follow
                    as they journey into the innermost sanctum.</p><br>

                    <p class="card-text">Ranganathaswamy temple is the only one out of the 108 temples that was sung in
                        praise by all the Azhwars (Divine saints of Tamil Bhakthi movement), having a total of 247
                        pasurams (divine hymns) against its name. Acharyas (guru) of all schools of thought â€“ Advaita,
                        Vishistadvaita and Dvaita recognise the immense significance of the temple, regardless of their
                        affiliations.

                        Nalayira Divya Prabhandam is a collection of 4000 hymns sung by twelve azhwars saints spread
                        over 300 years (from the late 6th to 9th century AD) and collected by Nathamuni (910â€“990
                        AD).Divya Desams refer to 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in Nalayira Divya
                        Prabandham. 105 of these are located in India, 1 in Nepal, while 2 are located outside of the
                        Earthly realms. Divya in Tamil language indicates premium and Desam indicates place or temple.
                        Periyalvar begins the decad on Srirangam with two puranic stories according to which Krishna
                        restored to life the son of his guru Sandeepani and the children of a brahmin.
                        Thondaradippodi Alvar and Thiruppaana Alvar have sung exclusively on Ranganatha. Andal attained
                        Sri Ranganatha on completion of her Thiruppavai (a composition of 30 verses) in Srirangam. In
                        total there are 247 hymns of the 4000 Pasurams dedicated to Ranganthar deity of this temple.
                        Except Madhurakavi Alvar, all the other eleven azhwars have created Mangalasasanam (praise)
                        about the Ranganathar in Srirangam. Out of 247, 35 are by Periyalvar, 10 by Aandaal, 31 by
                        Kulasekara Alvar, 14 by Thirumalisai Alvar, 55 by Thondaradippodi Alvar, 10 by Thiruppaan Alvar,
                        73 by Thirumangai Alvar, one by Poigai Alvar,4 by Bhoothathalvar, two by Peyalvar and twelve by
                        Nammalvar. Kulasekarar (Cheraman II) gave up his kingdom to his son during 798 AD and started
                        visiting temples and singing praises about them. He visited the temple, praised the presiding
                        deity and his works are compiled in Nalayira Divya Prabandam.</p>
